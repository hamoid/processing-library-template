# Processing Library Template

Gradle based.

1. Edit your settings in `gradle.properties`
2. Edit your code inside the src/ folder. You can use Java, Kotlin or both.
3. You can try your library code by writing programs inside the test folder.
   There are examples in both Kotlin and Java.
4. In the Gradle tab on the right, run shadow/shadowJar to build the library.
   It should be copied into your libraries folder if you followed step 1.
